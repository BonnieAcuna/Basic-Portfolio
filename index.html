                    I am a stay at home mother of two children.  
                A sixteen year old girl named Ken and a nine 
                year old boy named Duke.  My husbands name is 
                Angel.  I also have two dogs.  A yorkie named
                Goose, who I consider my second daughter and a 
                poodle mix named Mazel who is a rescue with mild
                PTSD.  We currently live in Rio Rico, which is 
                just south of Tucson. </p>
                <p id="solo">I like to workout and listen to yacht rock.  
                I also enjoy making costumes for cosplay.  My family and
                I go to multiple comic conventions a year and my
                children like to dress up for them.  I love to cook.  
                Especially vegan and foods from different countries.
